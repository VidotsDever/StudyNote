**网段**（`network segment`）一般指一个计算机网络中使用同一物理层设备（传输介质，中继器，集线器等）能够直接通讯的那一部分。

When we segment a network, we divide it into multiple smaller networks, each acting as its own small network called a subnet. 



 A **子网掩码**(subnet mask) is used to divide an IP address into two parts. One part identifies the host (computer), the other part identifies the network to which it belongs.
