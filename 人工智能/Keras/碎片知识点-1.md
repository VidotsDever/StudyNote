* The batch size is always omitted since only the shape of each sample is specified.

* Embedding layer output：(batch, sequence, embedding) ，其中，batch指定每一批样本数，sequence指定序列的长度，embedding指定embedding的维度

* The Embedding layer can be understood as a lookup table that maps from integer indices (which stand for specific words) to dense vectors (their embeddings).
